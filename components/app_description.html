<p>In the Pennsylvania School Data dataset, RFA brings together comprehensive Pennsylvania education data from various public sources into one spot. When possible, we have compiled the data longitudinally as far back as the 2006-07 school year and we provide the data at the school, Local Education Agency (LEA), and state level.<p>

<p>This Codebook describes each of the variables contained in the dataset, including the original source, years of availability, and rates of missing data. The following pages are organized by data subset (i.e., Finance, People, Outcomes, School Characteristics/Opportunities), then by data source (e.g., PDE Keystone Exam Results), and then by variable. Variables are presented in the order that they are reported in the datasets. Similar variables from different sources may not perfectly align.</p>

<p>Each <strong>data</strong> source, when relevant, includes notes from the original publisher or RFA about characteristics of the data and any considerations for the use of the data. In addition, for each variable, explanations are provided for any decisions made by RFA related to data construction. Data sources include the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE), National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data (CCD), and Office of Civil Rights (OCR) Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).</p>
